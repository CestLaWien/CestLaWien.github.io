The  _**C**ommunity **E**vent for **St**udents of **L**earning **A**lgorithms in **Vie**nna_ is a workshop aimed at PhD students in machine learning.


There is a surprising amount of machine learning research happening in universities in and around Vienna. However, there appears to be little cooperation between the various research units. To facilitate cooperation we are hosting a workshop aimed at PhD students in the area of machine learning called
 _**C**ommunity **E**vent for **St**udents of **L**earning **A**lgorithms in **Vie**nna_ (C'Est La Vie). The workshop will feature two keynote presentations, short presentations by PhD students and a poster session. All topics in the area of machine learning are welcome. We are still looking for students to present their research via a poster or a short presentation (< x minutes).

## Attendance Details
The workshop takes place at Festsaal (TU Wien) on Monday the 27.2.2023 starting at 8:00. If you are interested in joining please register here. Attending or presenting at the workshop is free.
