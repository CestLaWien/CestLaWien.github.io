C'Est La Wien is organized by machine learning PhD students from TU Wien and University of Vienna. This is a list of all of us and our research interests:
- [Franka Bause](https://dm.cs.univie.ac.at/team/person/112939/) (University of Vienna): Machine learning with graphs.
- [Tamara Drucks](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/people/tamara-drucks) (TU Wien): Graphs, optimization, and (deep) learning theory.
- [Patrick Indri](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/people/patrick-indri) (TU Wien): Trustworthy machine learning focusing on privacy and robustness.
- [Anice Jahanjoo](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/people/anice-jahanjoo) (TU Wien): Machine learning in Health Monitoring Systems and SAR Image processing.
- [Fabian Jogl](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/people/fabian-jogl) (TU Wien): Machine learning on graphs and especially graph neural networks. Combining ideas from algorithmics with machine learning.
- [Julian Lemmel](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/people/julian-lemmel) (TU Wien): Online Reinforcement Learning and continuous-depth models.
- [David Penz](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/people/david-penz) (TU Wien): Disentangled representations, knowledge transfer, and neuro-symbolic AI.
- [Maximilian Thiessen](https://maxthiessen.ml/) (TU Wien): Graph-based machine learning, active learning, and learning theory. Connects (graph) convexity theory with machine learning.
