C'Est La Vie is organized by machine learning PhD students from TU Wien and University of Vienna. This is a list of all of us and our research interests:
- Franka Bause (University of Vienna): Machine learning with graphs.
- Tamara Drucks (TU Wien): Graphs, optimization, and (deep) learning theory.
- Patrick Indri (TU Wien): Trustworthy machine learning focusing on privacy and robustness.
- Anice Jahanjoo (TU Wien): Machine learning in Health Monitoring Systems and SAR Image processing.
- Fabian Jogl (TU Wien): Machine learning on graphs and especially graph neural networks. Combining ideas from algorithmics with machine learning.
- David Penz (TU Wien): Disentangled representations, knowledge transfer, and neuro-symbolic AI.
- [Maximilian Thiessen](https://maxthiessen.ml/) (TU Wien): Graph-based machine learning, active learning, and learning theory. Connects (graph) convexity theory with machine learning.
